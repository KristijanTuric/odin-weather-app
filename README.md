# Weather App - Odin

The Website Demo can be found at: [Weather App](https://kristijanturic.github.io/odin-weather-app/)

Enter a city name and press Enter or click the Search Icon  
If a city you know of is not found, try to enter the country too  
For example: Pecs gives and error, but "Pecs, HU" or "Pecs, Hungary" works fine
